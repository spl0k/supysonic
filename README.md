Supysonic is a Python implementation of the [Subsonic][] server API.

Current supported features are:
* browsing (by folders or tags)
* streaming of various audio file formats
* transcoding
* user or random playlists
* cover art
* starred tracks/albums and ratings
* [Last.fm][lastfm] scrobbling
* [ListenBrainz][listenbrainz] scrobbling
* Jukebox mode
* LDAP authentification

Supysonic currently targets the version 1.12.0 of the Subsonic API. For more
details, go check the [API implementation status][docs-api].

## Documentation

Full documentation is available at https://supysonic.readthedocs.io/

## Quickstart

Use the following commands to install Supysonic, create an admin user, define a
library folder, scan it and start serving on port 5722 using [Gunicorn][].

    $ pip install supysonic
    $ pip install gunicorn
    $ supysonic-cli user add MyUserName
    $ supysonic-cli user setroles --admin MyUserName
    $ supysonic-cli folder add MyLibrary /home/username/Music
    $ supysonic-cli folder scan MyLibrary
    $ supysonic-server

You should now be able to enjoy your music with the client of your choice!

But using only the above commands will use a default configuration and
especially storing the database in a temporary directory. Head over to the
documentaiton for [full setup instructions][docs-setup], plus other options if
you don't want to use Gunicorn.

Note that there's also an optional [daemon][docs-daemon] that watches for
library changes and provides support for other features such as the
jukebox mode.

## Development stuff

For those wishing to collaborate on the project, since Supysonic uses [Flask][]
you can use its development server which provides automatic reloading and
in-browser debugging among other things. To start said server:

    $ export FLASK_APP="supysonic.web:create_application()"
    $ export FLASK_ENV=development
    $ flask run

And there's also the tests (which require `lxml` to run):

    $ pip install lxml
    $ python -m unittest
    $ python -m unittest tests.net.suite

The last command runs a few tests that make HTTP requests to remote third-party
services (namely Last.fm, ListenBrainz and ChartLyrics).
